"""PATCH0100_23 — Composite indexes for Message and CostEvent

Revision ID: 0015
Revises: 0014
Create Date: 2026-02-20

Adds:
  - ix_messages_org_thread    ON messages(org_slug, thread_id)
  - ix_cost_events_org_created ON cost_events(org_slug, created_at)

These are performance-critical for list_messages and admin_costs queries
at scale. Safe to apply on live DB (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY on Postgres).
